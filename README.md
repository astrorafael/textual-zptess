# Notes

from [Tasck Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71631247/textual-python-tui-enabling-long-running-external-asyncio-functionality)
Textual widgets have an internal message queue that processes events sequentially. Your on_mount handler is processing one of these events, but because it is an infinite loop, you are preventing further events for being processed.

If you want to process something in the background you will need to creat a new asyncio Task. Note that you canâ€™t await that task, since that will also prevent the handler from returning.
